    <p>These terms and conditions ("Terms") apply to your use of Santa Eats online ordering platform. All services provided by Santa Eats, including the services, information, features and functionality offered through our website at www.santaeats.co.uk (the "Website") and our mobile device application (“the Application”) are referred to herein as the “Service”.</p>
    <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. THESE TERMS AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THEN YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE OUR SERVICE.</p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time without incurring any liability or obligation. See below under the heading “Modification of The Service and Terms” for more information.

The personal information you provide through the Service will be collected, used, managed and disclosed in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We provide a way for you to order (“Order”) products or services (“Products”) from third party restaurants (“Restaurants”). Santa Eats is a limited agent for its Restaurant partners with the authority to offer a Restaurant’s Products for sale at the price shown through the Service. Santa Eats has the authority to accept or decline your Order on behalf of the Restaurant and collect payment for your Order on behalf of the Restaurant. Santa Eats also has the authority to provide certain discounts and promotional offers in connection with Products offered through the Service. Santa Eats does not provide the Products itself or operate any of the Restaurants, and is not itself a restaurant. Santa Eats is not responsible for the quality, character or safety of any Products available through the Service, that is the sole responsibility of the Restaurant. The provision of the Product and fulfilment of any Orders by the Restaurant to you constitutes an agreement entered into between you and the Restaurant. Santa Eats shall never be a party to such agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have to be at least the age of majority or older in your jurisdiction of residence in order to use the Service. If you reside in a jurisdiction that restricts the use of the Service because of your age, or restricts the ability to enter into contracts such as this one due to age, you must abide by such age limits and you must not use the Service.

By using the Service, you are entering into a contract with Santa Eats under these Terms. In order to be able to use the Service, you first need to sign-up with Santa Eats. When signing-up, you are obligated to provide Santa Eats with certain personal information, including your mobile telephone number and payment card data. Upon successfully signing-up with Santa Eats, Santa Eats will provide you with a personal account, accessible to you with a password of your choice.

You warrant that the information you provide to Santa Eats is accurate and complete and that you will keep the information you have provided to Santa Eats current through the Service. Santa Eats is entitled at all times to verify the information that you have provided and to refuse use of the Service without providing reasons.

In connection with your use of the Service, Santa Eats may send you electronic service messages. These electronic messages may be sent for various reasons, including to provide a receipt for your Order, for security purposes (e.g. verifying that your smartphone is connected to the phone number you entered upon registration) and for issues related to an Order you placed (e.g. if the Restaurant is out of stock of an item you ordered, you may be notified by text message). For information about promotional and marketing messages, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

MAKING AN ORDER

The Service allows you to send Orders to Restaurants. The GPS receiver – which should be installed on the mobile device on which you have downloaded the Application – detects your location and uses your location to optimize sending an Order to a Restaurant. Santa Eats has the sole and complete discretion to accept or reject each Order on behalf of the Restaurant. Once you have submitted your Order, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund of your Order. Santa Eats will notify you as soon as reasonably practicable if your Order is rejected for any reason. Your Order may be rejected at any time because the Restaurant is too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. If your Order is accepted, payment will be authorized by Santa Eats and you will be provided an estimate on when your Order will be ready. Neither Santa Eats nor the Restaurant guarantee that Orders will be ready for pick-up within the estimated times.

If you have any issues with your Order (including any issue regarding the accuracy of information provided through the Service), or wish to change or cancel your Order after it has been accepted, you may contact us directly (support@santaeats.co.uk) and we will assist you in resolving your issue. We cannot guarantee that we can resolve any complaint or issue you have because resolution is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant once an Order has been accepted. If we are unable to assist you in resolving a complaint, you will need to address it directly with the Restaurant. All complaints regarding the quality of any Products should be addressed directly to the Restaurant. Santa Eats has no obligation to compensate you for any dispute you may have with any Restaurant.

The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of your credit card issuer in addition to these Terms. Santa Eats is not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor.

PROMOTIONS AND REWARDS

Santa Eats may, in Santa Eats sole discretion, provide offers, programs and promotions (“Promos”) that allow you to obtain account credits, reward points, or other features or benefits related to the Services and/or a third party provider's services (collectively, “Promo Benefits”). Promos may be subject to additional terms and conditions that Santa Eats establishes from time to time. You agree that:

Promos must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner;

Promos may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by Santa Eats;

Promos may be changed, terminated or disabled by Santa Eats at any time for any reason without prior notice or liability to Santa Eats;

One Promo cannot be combined with any other Promo unless expressly permitted by Santa Eats in the terms of the Promo;

Promo Benefits may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that Santa Eats establishes for the applicable Promo; and

Promo Benefits are not redeemable for cash and may be subject to expiration or termination conditions.

Certain Promos may only be available to new users. New users are natural persons who have not yet created a Santa Eats account. New users may also be required to complete an Order before being eligible for any Promo offer and the Promo Benefits. Additional terms and conditions specific to new user Promos may be specified by Santa Eats from time to time.

Santa Eats reserves the right to delay delivery of Promo Benefits pending verification that a user has complied with the terms of the Promo, including verification of the user's identity. Santa Eats users that make a referral code available to others must not make any false or misleading representations related to Santa Eats or the benefits a new user may receive upon signing-up for Santa Eats. Santa Eats reserves the right to deduct or cancel Promo Benefits in the event that Santa Eats determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable Promo terms or these Terms.

Account credits provided by Santa Eats, whether as a Promo Benefit, through the redemption of rewards points or otherwise provided by Santa Eats through any means, have no cash value and will only apply in the local currency and are not transferable. If a purchase on Santa Eats exceeds the account credit value in your account, the remaining balance will be charged to the registered credit card. Account credits may be cancelled and removed from your account. Unless otherwise specified in the particular Promo, account credits are subject to cancellation by Santa Eats at any time and may be removed from your account at Santa Eats discretion.

Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Santa Eats reserves the right to cancel and/or expire any rewards points in your account after one year of account inactivity.
